<p>Q. Hack Harder... what is it, exactly?<br>
A. We're trying to strip away the pageantry that seems to go with
most computer security themed conferences in favor of a smaller,
more technically-oriented gathering. It's fun to have parties,
dress up in costume, drink a lot, etc. but the goal of HH is to get
together and enjoy a distillation of the more technical aspects of
computers, conferences, and hacking things. Rather than going to a
talk and having one person broadcast their ideas to an audience, we
want to have one or more presenters explain a thing for 30 or 60
minutes, and then guide the group through hands-on activities to
reinforce the ideas and enjoy applying them.</p>
<p>Q. What sort of activities would I be doing?<br>
A. Some of the ideas we have been considering include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Decoding POCSAG with SDR: (

)</li>
<li>Zigbee Wardriving</li>
<li>Airplane stuff: ADS-B, ACARS, etc.</li>
<li>Assmbly Language workshop & games</li>
<li>Fun with wearables</li>
<li>Design & build an electronic badge</li>
</ul>
<p>Q. Who are you?<br>
A. We're a group of friends with similar interests that enjoy
bending technology to our individual and collective wills.</p>

<p>Q. Why do you call it &quot;Hack Harder&quot;?<br />A. Because 
<a href="https://twitter.com/MrB0t">@MrB0t</a>got 
<a href="https://twitter.com/MrB0t/status/817576130706309120">a tattoo</a> 
and we liked it.</p>
<p>Q. How many people will be there?<br>
A. For now, we're thinking of capping it at 50 people. The current
thinking is we'd all get more out of a smaller event. Ten or
fifteen people who are really interested in the activity will be
more fun than just filling a room.</p>
<p>Q. Is this an Information Security conference?<br>
A. No. The lines can get pretty blurry sometimes. Here we're
looking for folks who enjoy technology and hacking things just
because they are curious about them.</p>
<p>Q. When is it? <br />A. Friday March 10th, 2017. The day 
before <a href="https://twitter.com/indybsides">@indybsides</a></p>
<p>Q. Where is it? <br /> A. Same venue as <a href="https://twitter.com/indybsides">@indybsides</a>:
<br />&nbsp; <br />Ivy Tech Corporate College and Culinary Center 2820 North Meridian Street Indianapolis</p>
<p>Q. It sounds interesting, I wonder if it's right for me?<br>
A. If you aren't sure, reach out. We're happy to talk with you
before you commit. Look for the handle
